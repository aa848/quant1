# Recitation 3: Get help 
McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University


## Key Ideas:
 - Help files
 - Minimal reproducible example

## Often the fastest answer is the one you find yourself

- It's important to try to answer your own questions first using resources such as:
	- Stata help files
	- Stata pdf manuals
	- www.statalist.org
	- Stata youtube channel: www.youtube.com/user/statacorp
	- Google

- If the answer to your question is in the help file or the top hit on Google, the answer to your question will be, "Read the documentation" or ["Google it"](http://bit.ly/YcP0TF)

## Help Files:

- We have used several complicated commands with options and if statements.
- You do not have to memorize these commands.
- Every command has a help page to tell you how to use it.

### Example 1: count
```
help count
```

* Overview of help page, including `Also See`
* Explain syntax elements relevant to count command:
	* **bold** - type as is
	* ***italics*** - replace with your own variables or expression
	* [brackets] - optional
	* underline - shortest abbreviation
	* blue - hyperlinks

```
clear
sysuse auto
count if foreign==1
cou   if price > 5000
coun  in 1/5
```

### Example 2: list 
* Look at another help page: list
```
help list 
```

* Two new elements: `[varlist]' and `[, options]'
* Both are optional, so the command works fine without either one.

* list the observations that we counted previously:
```
list if foreign==1
l    if price > 5000
li   in 1/5
```
* in 1/l will list all of the elements
* l refers to the last element in the list
* you can also list from the end of the list using the - sign

```
list in -2/l
```

### `varlist'
* Follow link to `varlist' help page
* Don't worry about factor variables and time-series operators for now
* Examples of varlist
```
list make in 1/5
list make price mpg in 1/5
list make-mpg in 1/5
list t* in 1/5
```

### `options`
* a list of one or more options can follow the comma
* you only need one comma, even if there are multiple options
* *remember, there are no commas between a list of variables
* the comma is always placed after any if or in statements
* options can be in any order
* options can be abbreviated, just like regular commands
* Examples of options
```
list make in 1/5 , noobs
list in 1/5 , abbrev(5)
list make price in 1/5 , noobs divider mean(price) 
list make if price > 10000 , sepby(foreign)
list make price foreign if price > 10000 , sepby(foreign)
```

### Example 3: tabstat
* notice varlist (at least one variable) is required for this command
`tabstat if foreign==1` results in an error 
`tabstat price mpg weight`
* The `by(varname)` option requires a single variable  
`tabstat price mpg weight , by(foreign)`
* The second option `statistics(statname [...])` is more complicated
* Scroll down to the Options section of the help page for more info
```
tabstat price mpg weight , by(foreign) stats(mean sd)
tabstat price mpg weight , by(rep78) stats(mean sd max min)
```

### For more help on reading help pages, see:
* Pdf documentation:
	* GSW 10: Listing data and basic command syntax
	* U 11: Language syntax
* Help pages
	* `help language`

## Leaning New Commands
* Most help pages are easy to find by guessing the command name and `See Also`
	* look at the `See Also` menu from the `summarize` help page

* There are a few help pages that are worth remembering:
	1. help contents
 	2. help language
 	3. help operators
	4. help resources - includes link to Stata youtube channel

## Minimal reproducible example

### Why?
>My stata prompted error when I try to count the missing values.

When you ask other people for help, youâ€™ll get the most useful advice if you know how to make a *minimal reproducible example*. A reproducible example is a sample of code and data that any other user can run and get the same results as you do. A minimal reproducible example is the smallest possible example that illustrates the problem.

### Four parts of minimal reproducible example
A minimal reproducible example consists of the following items :
- A minimal dataset, necessary to reproduce the error
- The minimal (runnable) code necessary to reproduce the error, which can be run on the given dataset.
- The necessary information on the Stata version and system it is run on.

### Example
#### Provide a minimal dataset
- Use example data set in STATA
```
sysuse auto
```
- Use a subset of data you are using. For example, draw a 10% sample from your data
```
sysuse auto, clear
sample 10
```

#### Provide minimal (runnable) code
```
* (WRONG)
sysuse auto, clear
count if rep78=.
```

#### STATA version and system
- Click `About Stata ...`

### Challenge Questions
* When invalid commands are put into Stata, it generates an error
* The error message gives you an idea of what went wrong
* Generate the following errors
```
varlist required
variable _____ not found
option by not allowed
invalid syntax
type mismatch
```
