# Recitation 3: Help files and command syntax 
McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University


## Key Ideas:
 - Help files


## Help Files:

- We used several complicated commands today with options and if statements.
- You do not have to memorize these commands.
- Every command has a help page to tell you how to use it.


    help count

* Overview of help page, including `Also See`
* Explain syntax elements relevant to count command:
	* **bold** - type as is
	* ***italics*** - replace with your own variables or expression
	* [brackets] - optional
	* underline - shortest abbreviation
	* blue - hyperlinks

* Use `Also See` to go to help page for tabulate oneway
* Explain new syntax elements: varname, options (skip `weights`)
* For more in depth description and examples, go to manual entry with `Also See`

* Look at another help page: tabstat

    >help tabstat

* Explain varname vs. varlist
* Go through examples on tabstat help page

* Most help pages are easy to find by guessing the command name and `See Also`
* But there are a few that are worth remembering:

	1. help contents_should_know
 	2. help language
 	3. help operators
* If you forget these, they can all be found within a few clicks using menus:
